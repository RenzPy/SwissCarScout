"""Telegram intake — send the bot a listing, get a verdict back.

Replaces editing manual.yaml over SSH. You're standing in front of a car, you
copy the Facebook advert, you paste it to the bot, and a few seconds later it
replies with the score, the market median, and what to ask the seller.

    python run.py --listen

The listing still lands in manual.yaml as well, so there's a plain-text record
you can edit and re-run. The bot is an input method, not a second database.

WHAT IT ACCEPTS
---------------
Any text message: a pasted advert, or a URL with some text around it.
Commands: /stats, /help.

SECURITY
--------
Only messages from TG_CHAT are processed. Anything from another chat is logged
and dropped — a bot token is guessable enough that this matters, and the bot
writes to your database.

Message text is treated as data throughout: it is extracted from, never
executed, and the AI's output is coerced into typed fields before it touches
the database. See radar/ai.py.

ONE POLLER AT A TIME
--------------------
Telegram allows a single getUpdates consumer per bot token. Running --listen
twice, or alongside anything else polling the same bot, gets you HTTP 409. Use
one instance.

HELP = """<b>🚗 Car Radar</b>

Paste a car advert and I'll parse it, store it, compare it against the Swiss \
market and tell you what to ask the seller. Send photos and I'll tell you \
what's visible on them.

<b>📊 Market prices</b>

<code>/price audi a3</code>
The spread for a model: what private sellers ask, what garages ask, and what \
has actually disappeared from the listings. A single figure across all years \
isn't a price, so it'll ask you to narrow it.

<code>/price audi a3 2011 150000</code>
A real number. Year and mileage both move the price hard — a 2012 A5 at 90k \
and at 220k are different cars worth thousands apart.

<code>/models</code>
Which models have enough indexed listings to price. The ones with the most \
data give the most trustworthy answers.

<b>💼 Your deals</b>

<code>/deal 3200 seat leon 2007 121000</code>
What-if before you commit: estimated resale, costs, margin, and the most you \
can pay and still make your target. Nothing is saved.

<code>/bought 3200 seat leon 2007 121000</code>
Log a purchase. Snapshots what the tool estimated the car was worth at that \
moment — so later you can see how right it was.

<code>/cost 1 300 quarter glass</code> — add a repair or expense to deal #1
<code>/sold 1 4900</code> — close deal #1 and see the real profit

<code>/ledger</code>
Open positions, capital tied up, total profit, and how far off the estimates \
have been. After four or five sales, this tells you which of the tool's \
numbers to trust.

<b>⚙️ What the hunt does</b>

<code>/budget 5200</code>
The most you'll pay. Anything dearer stops alerting — your working capital, \
not a wish.

<code>/range 2200 5800</code>
The price window searched on AutoScout24. Below the floor is export and scrap \
dealer stock; above your ceiling is someone else's market.

<code>/threshold buy 6</code>
How high a listing must score before it reaches your phone. Lower it if you're \
seeing nothing, raise it if you're seeing noise. Works for <code>broker</code> too.

<code>/stale 40</code>
Days before a listing counts as stale. A seller who has sat unsold this long \
has met the time-wasters and is ready to talk.

<code>/show</code> — every setting, marking which you changed from the file
<code>/reset</code> — undo everything set here, back to config.yaml

<b>ℹ️ Info</b>

<code>/stats</code> — how much is indexed, how many models are priced, which \
build is running
<code>/help</code> — this message

<i>Scores are a sorting hint, not a verdict. The market medians are real data; \
the keyword weights around them are rules of thumb.</i>"""
